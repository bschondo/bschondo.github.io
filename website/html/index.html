            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <br>
            <p>I am an experienced, passionate software developer working at Amazon Robotics in Woburn, MA. My areas of interest include but are not limited to robotics, autonomous systems, cyber-security, and backend development. When I&#39;m not coding, a big part of my life is music. I was a four member of the clarinet section in the Michigan Marching Band and I&#39;m not in the process of learning to play guitar. My other interests include rock climbing, reading, biking, taekwondo, and sustainability.</p>

                        I worked on a team of four interns to develop a web application to automate requesting, approving, creating, and cleaning SAN storage. Since the team consisted of only interns, I gained experience making code architecture decisions and deciding which customer deliverables needed prioritization. I led the efforts to build a Python API to interface with the switches and storage containers used for testing. In addition, I developed a large portion of the back-end Flask Rest API  and the MongoDB database used by the application. The application we created was estimated to increase testing efficiency by 24%, leading to an anticipated savings of $1.45 million in savings per year.

                        Throughout my internship, I worked on both the testing and query management team (cmdcomp). On the testing team, I added a code static analysis tool to run nightly on the codebase through the Gitlab CI/CD pipeline and provide a report in the morning of bugs/errors found. I also built a dashboard to generate graphs of the information created by the CI/CD pipelines focusing on average queue time, run time, and the number of pipelines in a given time. These projects will help ensure that bugs are caught early in the development process and help the testing team find holes in the testing infrastructure. On the cmdcomp team, I worked on adding compatibility for functions from SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and Oracle/PLSQL to allow Ocient&#39;s database to be compatible with many different querying languages. Working on this team gave me more exposure to the inner workings of the codebase and was great practice for writing production-ready code.

                        I worked side-by-side with full-time employees to develop automated driving and mapping software. This involved using the ROS2 framework to send custom messages between different modules in the project. In addition, I built an algorithm to calculate lane level localization and lane center offset of vehicles based on vehicle coordinates and lane polynomials in Python. Finally, I built a data pipeline to interpret lane level map information and provide it in the right format for driving policy training and implementation.

                        I taught myself how to program in MATLAB and use Simulink modeling software with no prior experience. After learning the basics I then applied it in order to understand a model of an 8-speed transmission. I then made adjustments to the transmission model in order to get the results from the model to match real-world vehicle readings. Finally, I analyzed my changes and made recommendations on how the transmission model could be changed to be more accurate.

First, coordinates are read in that specify the locations where drones can pick-up and drop-off packages. Then the program figures out the fastest way to visit every location on campus once and then returning to its starting location. To solve this problem, I first generated a starting path with a Nearest Insertion algorithm. Then to get closer to the best solution, I used a branch-and-bound recursive algorithm that used Prim&#39;s algorithms to determine if a branch was promising.</p>

Part two involved writing a program in Go to read network traffic data to search for IP and MAC addresses exhibiting sketchy behavior. Such behavior included sending many more SYN packets than SYN+ACK packets or sending many unsolicited ARP replies. Part three of the project was to write a program to execute a man in the middle attack in GO. This included intercepting and spoofing DNS requests to a bank server from the client towards my IP. I also acted as an HTTP proxy, relaying the client&#39;s request to the bank&#39;s server and sending responses back. The twist in the project was to intercept all credentials/cookies sent by the client, in addition to changing any money transfer request to be sent to my bank account without alerting the client.</p>

To complete the project, I was responsible for finding tokens (ex. #token-ThisIsAToken) hidden in the hard drive and websites. To accomplish this task, I had to use many of the cryptographic skills I learned about in the course, include steganography, ciphers, buffer-overflow, cross-site scripting, brute force password hacking, and an understanding of the Linux environment. The most interesting part of the project involved signing a secret message with the private key found on the hard drive and sending it as a query to a server. Also, the user agent of the request had to be found in a steganographic image inside the hard drive. Solving this puzzle gave me the URL of a secret messaging board on Tor that the suspected criminal was known to use. Getting to this messaging board provided the necessary information to explain in my report which crimes the suspect had committed.</p>

                                <p>In this project, I designed and implemented a pager (the part of the kernel that handles virtual address spaces). My pager provided allowed processes to read and write data to swap files and/or regular files. Data stored in swap files are private to processes and are freed when the process exits. Data in regular files could be accessed simultaneously by processes and lived beyond the lifetime of any given process. Programs used the pager by making calls to vm_map(filename, block), which returned a pointer to the correct memory location.</p>

                                <p>This project consisted of creating an Instagram clone with a templated static site generator. I learned how to use HTML, CSS, templates, Python, and basic shell scripts. The first part of the project involved making the HTML templates using the jinja framework. The next step was to add CSS and generate the JSON data for the templates. Finally, I used Python to retrieve data from the JSON files to populate the templates and generate the HTML to send to the client. Throughout this and future projects, shell scripts were used to compile and run all the necessary files to host the site locally.</p>

The most significant change was the introduction of Flask to handle all the server-side functionality. Flask also helped implement sessions to handle account login and connecting to an SQLite database to read/store user information.</p>

When anything needed to be modified on the site, the client-side Javascript would make a call to the REST API to update the server-side database, in addition to updating the DOM. By converting the site to be client-side, I was able to implement double click to like, infinite scroll, and allow content to update without refreshing. </p>

Each worker would receive an executable to run, input directory, and output directory from the master. After completing its task, it would send a message to the master letting it know it was available for more tasks. Also, workers continually sent heartbeat messages to the master so it would know which workers were still online. The master handled all heartbeat messages using a UDP thread and all other messages using a TCP thread. Finally, the master was responsible for reassigning jobs to other workers from workers who had failed.</p>

The next step was building a REST API to act as an index server. The server would load the inverted index (calculated beforehand) and PageRank (provided) into memory on startup. Then, whenever the server received a query request, it would calculate the weight score for every document relevant to the query and return them in sorted order. The final part of the project was to create a search interface to act as the front end. The search interface was a server-side dynamic page, sending queries to the index server and using the response to update the page.</p>

The game is meant to be played by large groups of people. Each person will be given another player as their target, who they then have to try and take a picture of without being noticed. The part of the app I worked on was the camera interface. I have since transitioned to being part of the cyber security team to learn more about the field and about competing in hackathons.
