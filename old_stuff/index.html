                    Throughout my virtual internship, I worked on both the testing and query management team (cmdcomp). On the testing team, I added a code static analysis tool to run nightly on the codebase through the Gitlab CI/CD pipeline and provide a report in the morning
                    of bugs/errors found. I also built a dashboard to generate graphs of the information created by the CI/CD pipelines focusing on average queue time, run time, and the number of pipelines in a given time. These projects will help ensure
                    that bugs are caught early in the development process and help the testing team find holes in the testing infrastructure. On the cmdcomp team, I worked on adding compatibility for functions from SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and Oracle/PLSQL
                    to allow Ocient's database to be compatible with many different querying languages. Working on this team gave me more exposure to the inner workings of the codebase and was great practice for writing production-ready code.

                    I worked side-by-side with full-time employees to develop automated driving and mapping software. This involved using the ROS2 framework to send custom messages between different modules in the project. In addition, I built an algorithm to calculate
                    lane level localization and lane center offset of vehicles based on vehicle coordinates and lane polynomials in Python. Finally, I built a data pipeline to interpret lane level map information and provide it in the right format for

                    I taught myself how to program in MATLAB and use Simulink modeling software with no prior experience. After learning the basics I then applied it in order to understand a model of an 8-speed transmission. I then made adjustments to the transmission model in order to get the results from the model to match real-world vehicle readings. Finally, I analyzed my changes and made recommendations on how the transmission model could be changed to be more accurate.

                            The purpose of this project was to resize an inputted image to specified dimensions using a technique called seam carving. Seam carving works by finding and removing “seams” in the image that pass through the least important pixels. After having reduced
                            the image to the right dimensions, the program would save the resized versions to a new file with the dimensions in the file name.

                            Buttons are used to unlock their corresponding door, and traps close all doors. The solver works by making a list of all possible moves and linking them together until one gets to the goal.

                            This project was based around creating a company that handled on-campus delivery at universities using drones and is similar to the traveling salesman problem. First, coordinates are read in that specify the locations where drones can pick-up and drop-off
                            packages. Then the program figures out the fastest way to visit every location on campus once and then returning to its starting location. To solve this problem, I first generated a starting path with a Nearest Insertion algorithm.
                            Then to get closer to the best solution, I used a branch-and-bound recursive algorithm that used Prim's algorithms to determine if a branch was promising.

                            Once finished I then built a linker that could combine multiple object files into an executable machine code file. Finally, I wrote an assembly function that calculated combinations using recursion which was compiled with my
                            assembler and linker to be joined with a main file to be executed.

                            for each run of the program. This means the simulator needs to be made in such a way that it would work with any of a fully associative cache, a direct-mapping cache, or a set-associative cache.

Each attack had multiple levels of defense that needed to be broken, with each level increasing in difficulty and requiring a different approach. The website provided for the project included a login field, along with a search bar to search a database and a history bar of recent searches. The SQL injection was performed on the login part of the site and had defenses that included escaping quotes in the user input and applying a hash function to the password field. The XSS attack was executed in the search bar, and its defenses included removing the word script, common HTML tags, and some types of punctuation. The CSRF attack involved building a URL that would log the current user into an attacker's account on the insecure website when visited.

The first part consisted of analyzing network traffic data in Wireshark to determine what type of devices were communicating on the network. Part two involved writing a program in Go to read network traffic data to search for IP and MAC addresses exhibiting sketchy behavior. Such behavior included sending many more SYN packets than SYN+ACK packets or sending many unsolicited ARP replies. Part three of the project was to write a program to execute a man in the middle attack in GO. This included intercepting and spoofing DNS requests to a bank server from the client towards my IP. I also acted as an HTTP proxy, relaying the client's request to the bank's server and sending responses back. The twist in the project was to intercept all credentials/cookies sent by the client, in addition to changing any money transfer request to be sent to my bank account without alerting the client.

Some techniques I used to overcome these defenses include NOP sleds, return-to-libc, and return-oriented programming.

                            The final and most enjoyable project in this course involved using digital forensics to look into an individual's hard drive and related websites to writing a report about whether the suspect committed a crime. To complete the project, I was responsible for finding tokens (ex. #token-ThisIsAToken) hidden in the hard drive and websites. To accomplish this task, I had to use many of the cryptographic skills I learned about in the course, include steganography, ciphers, buffer-overflow, cross-site scripting, brute force password hacking, and an understanding of the Linux environment. The most interesting part of the project involved signing a secret message with the private key found on the hard drive and sending it as a query to a server. Also, the user agent of the request had to be found in a steganographic image inside the hard drive. Solving this puzzle gave me the URL of a secret messaging board on Tor that the suspected criminal was known to use. Getting to this messaging board provided the necessary information to explain in my report which crimes the suspect had committed.

                            This project consisted of creating an Instagram clone with a templated static site generator. I learned how to use HTML, CSS, templates, Python, and basic shell scripts. The first part of the project involved making the HTML templates using the jinja framework. The next step was to add CSS and generate the JSON data for the templates. Finally, I used Python to retrieve data from the JSON files to populate the templates and generate the HTML to send to the client. Throughout this and future projects, shell scripts were used to compile and run all the necessary files to host the site locally.

                            This project transitions the static site generator into a server-side, dynamic version of the Instagram clone. It reused the templates from the previous project and rendered them on demand when a user loads a page. New features include creating, updating, and deleting users, posts, comments, and likes. The most significant change was the introduction of Flask to handle all the server-side functionality. Flask also helped implement sessions to handle account login and connecting to an SQLite database to read/store user information.

                            This final version of the Instagram clone implements it as a client-side dynamic page. Although many parts of the server-side version were able to be reused, a REST API and Javascript were added to handle the client-side components. When anything needed to be modified on the site, the client-side Javascript would make a call to the REST API to update the server-side database, in addition to updating the DOM. By converting the site to be client-side, I was able to implement double click to like, infinite scroll, and allow content to update without refreshing.

                            In this project, I implemented a map-reduce server using python. It was a single machine, multi-process, multi-threaded server that executed user-submitted MapReduce jobs. The project was split up into a Master and Workers. Each worker would receive an executable to run, input directory, and output directory from the master. After completing its task, it would send a message to the master letting it know it was available for more tasks. Also, workers continually sent heartbeat messages to the master so it would know which workers were still online. The master handled all heartbeat messages using a UDP thread and all other messages using a TCP thread. Finally, the master was responsible for reassigning jobs to other workers from workers who had failed.

                            In this project, I built a scalable search engine similar in design to a commercial search engine. This search engine implements reverse indexing using MapReduce and PageRank using tf-idf. To create the inverted index table, a MapReduce program was used containing multiple reduction functions. The next step was building a REST API to act as an index server. The server would load the inverted index (calculated beforehand) and PageRank (provided) into memory on startup. Then, whenever the server received a query request, it would calculate the weight score for every document relevant to the query and return them in sorted order. The final part of the project was to create a search interface to act as the front end. The search interface was a server-side dynamic page, sending queries to the index server and using the response to update the page.

                    Marching band has also helped me off the field. I find that I have better spatial awareness and work better with other people since I started marching. This is by far the activity into which I put the most time and effort.

                    I joined Michigan Hackers during the Winter of my Freshman year. I joined the android development team which had started developing a game called Photo Assassin. The game is meant to be played by large groups of people. Each person will be given another
                    player as their target, who they then have to try and take a picture of without being noticed. The part of the app I worked on was the camera interface. I have since transitioned to being part of the cyber security team to learn more
